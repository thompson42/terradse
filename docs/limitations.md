## Limitations

The terraform script presented in this section only focuses on the most fundamental AWS resources for DSE and OpsCenter installation and operation, such as EC2 instances and security groups in particular, For other AWS resources such as VPC, IP Subnet, and so on, we just rely on the default as provided by AWS. But the script should be very easy to extend to include other customized AWS resources.
